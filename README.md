# Multimedia
Projects we worked on during a course on Multimedia: mainly PC graphics and video coding, prediction of the movement.
Most of the exercises included various transformations such as 2D-DCT, 2D-WHT, difference between two pictures meant 
to be used for prediction of the movement.
The project in this subject was prediction of the movement: Full-search algorithm and One-at-the-time Search algorithm.
